        <h1>Life with Grandma's Love </h1>

    <p><em>My grandmothers told me that I can always find my way home, to treat others the way that I want to be treated because every thing that you do comes back to you or your loved ones, three-fold, and Creator loves us.</em> <strong>They meant that no matter how far I got from myself that I can find my way back to my heart, be kind to all, and that I am loved through this journey called life.</strong> There were times where I felt safe around certain people or at a specific locations but I was so far from my own heart that I had no idea how to start to love, forgive, where to start healing, or how to feel safe within myself again.</p>

    <p>Through many journeys in my life I have had the pleasure to meet many awesome people. Some were kind and loving, others were critical and judgemental, granny would say those judgemental and critical ones are only judging and criticizing themselves, let them be. The 70's was pretty rough on the rez during I spent time there, there was much alcohol, hockey tournaments, rodeos, ball tournaments near every weekend. Some underaged kids were left to fend for themselves, with extended family, or left with gramma. The 70's & 80's had much death, suicide, alcohol, sexual abuse, rape, lies and gossip. Today it is called economic violence, political and institutional violence, sexual or gender violence, cultural violence, religious violence, cyber-bullying, and information violence.</p>

    <p>While growing up, I had spent more time with my paternal gramma than my own parents who were separated. When I wasn't with my paternal gramma I survived with my cousins or extended family, we looked after each other, did the best that we could. When things got too wild in my young life, my gramma would show up and bring me to her home, my safe haven. We all helped with chores, including packing water because there was no running water until the early to mid 80's. I learned how to keep the house warm by wood stove and to help prepare the sweathouse. All year round twice a week we would have a cleansing sweathouse, medicine would be added in the hot water barrel by the fire, I had clean clothes, my was hair brushed, I had a safe place to sleep, a loving hug, and an abundance of food. This was gramma's love.</p>

    <p>With great love and hope of all of the grandma's, we have an awesome future ahead of us."Keep kind, you never know what is going on within their home."</p>

    <p>Through my grandma's love, she was able to help me to release those that had passed on by telling me that their job on Earth is done, anything that gran said was the absoute truth. As I grew older I did my best to cope with the deaths including miscarriages and various abuses through alcohol, which created more dispair. Various times in my life I had asked three doctors for anti-depressants, they each disagreed and told me that they thought that I could find another way to help myself. There were times when I found a great councillor that I had trusted and each had helped me to heal a little more. I had also started to colour, journal, bead, use traditional medicines, combine EFT and Ho'oponopono with essential oils, walk, enjoy the sunshine, breathe fresh air, and drink spring water to start to heal.</p>

    <p>One day I had found a short video about tapping/EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique), with Nick Ortner and Louise Hay. Even though we did not have the same experiences, going through the easy tapping movements and saying the words, I had felt relief in my heart, mind, and body for the first time in a long time. Sometime while working through Nick Ortners book, "The Tapping Solution", I had finally awaken without the "crazy shit" repeating through my mind, lies that I thought were true.</p>


  <p>With every breath and heartbeat the whole self wants to be healthy, including; the heart, mind, body, and spirit. As for grey hair and age, I appreciate every new day because Creator has blessed each and every one of us with this gift called life. I have some family members that had not yet reached mid-teens or as of to this day have not yet learned to love and forgive themselves. Cheers to all of the grandmothers that unconditionally loved each and every one of us in great hopes to make a better world than each of them were raised in. Cheers to my sober gramma who did not push religion onto me but showed how to collect medicines and preserve from the land. Cheers to my religious alcoholic gramma who showed me that no matter how much a person is hurt, they will most likely keep hurting themselves with alcohol until they can forgive themselves for things beyond their control, including the past. Bless my spritual gramma who showed unconditional love by continously praying for me. Bless the "retired registered nurse" gramma who encouraged me to take care of myself when I was a young mother with my first son. Bless the grammas who have raised children and grandchildren (biological or adopted) and did the best that they could to raise a new generation.</p>

  <p>These words are for a mixture of all of the kind, beautiful, strong, loving, caring, outspoken, understanding, patient, and powerful women that helped me to be alive today. Bless you for your unconditional love.</p>

  <h2 id="links">Links for Daily Practices to Become Stronger and Heathier</h2>
  <p>I add these links in hopes to help you feel at peace within your own  heart, mind, body, and energy. Each day I light a candle, light the smudge and smudge myself, go outside and feel the sunshine while I breath in fresh air, at meal time we do a food offering and say prayers. Some days are a mixture of all of these practices and others days are prayers. I have faith that the Creator has the perfect path for each and every one of you and your loved ones.</p>
