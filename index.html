    <p>My grandma told me that I can always find my way home. She meant that no matter how far I go from myself, that I can find my way back to my heart. There were people or places where I felt safe but I was so far from my own heart that I had no idea where to go or how to start to heal myself. </p>
    <p>Through many journeys in my life. I have had the pleasure to meet many awesome people. Some were kind and some were judgemental but the kind always win, those judgemental ones are only judging themselves. Growing up during the 70's was pretty rough on the rez, parties, hockey, rodeo, kids left for days at a time to fend for themselves. My cousins and I had taken it upon ourselves to look after each other, we did the best that we could.</p>
    <p>The 70's & 80's were filled with death, suicide, alcohol, sexual abuse, rape, lies and gossip. Most of the males had commite suicide on my mom's side of the family by the 90's.</p>
    <p>Through my grandma's love, she was able to help me to release those that had passed on by telling me that their job on Earth is done.</p>
