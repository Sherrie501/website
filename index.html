      <h1>Life with Grandma's Love </h1>
      <p>I do not know about you but I do know that I would be lost without any of my awesome grandma's. Unconditioinal love through all dimensions.</p>

    <p>My grandma once told me that I can always find my way home  and to treat others the way I want to be treated. She meant that no matter how far I got from myself, I can always find my way back to my heart. There were people or places where I felt safe but I was so far from my own heart that I had no idea where to go or how to start to heal my heart. </p>
    <p>Through many journeys in my life I have had the pleasure to meet many awesome people. Some were kind and some were judgemental, she'd say, those judgemental ones are only judging themselves let them be. Growing up during the 70's was pretty rough on the rez, there were many parties, hockey tournaments, rodeos, ball tournaments, and kids left for days at a time to fend for themselves, with family or left with the neighbourhood gramma. When I wasn't with my paternal gramma I was with my cousins, we had taken it upon ourselves to look after each other and we did the best that we could all year round, day or night.</p>
    <p>While growing up, I had spent more time with my paternal gramma than my own divorced parents. When things got too wild in my young life, my gramma would show up and bring me to her safe home. We would build a sweathouse, put medicine in the hot water barrel by the fire, I had clean clothes, my hair brushed, a safe place to sleep, a hug, regular school, and an abundance of food. This was gramma's love.</p>
    <p>The 70's & 80's were filled with death, suicide, alcohol, sexual abuse, rape, lies and gossip. Most of the males had commite suicide on my mom's side of the family by the 90's. There is still suicide within my community.</p>
    <p>With great love and hopes of all of the grandma's, we have an awesome future ahead of us."Keep kind, you never know what is going on within their own home."</p>
    <p>Through my grandma's love, she was able to help me to release those that had passed on by telling me that their job on Earth is done. As I grew older I did my best to cope with all of these deaths and abuse  through alcohol, which created more dispair. One day I was crying outside because I had had enough of the "crazy shit" that was going on in my mind, horrible words repeateding. I found a short video about tapping/EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique), I followed along and felt relief in my heart for the first time in a long, long time. During that same time I had reconnected with another grandma who had reminded me about essential oils and she also told me about Ho'oponopono, I combined it with tapping/EFT. </p>
    <p>With every breath and heartbeat the whole body wants to be healthy, including; the heart, mind, body, and spirit.</p>
    <p>Cheers to all of the grandmothers that unconditionally loved each and every one of us in great hopes to make a better world than each of them  had grown in. Cheers to my sober gramma who did not push religion onto me but showed how to collect medicines and preserve from the land. Cheers to my alcoholic gramma who showed me that no matter how much a person is hurt, they will most likely keep hurting themselves until they can forgive themselves for things beyond their control. Bless my spritual gramma who showed unconditional love at any point in my life and always prayed for me. Bless the "retired registered nurse" gramma who told me how to take care of my physical body. Bless the grammas who have adoped and taken in any child and did the best they could to raise a new generation.</p>
    <p>This is a mixture of all of the beautiful, strong, loving, caring women that helped me to be alive today. Bless you for your patience, kindness, and unconditional love.</P>
