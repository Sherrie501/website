    <p>My grandmothers told me that I can always find my way home, to treat others the way that I want to be treated because every thing that you do comes back to you or your loved ones, three-fold, Creator sees everything including intentions. She meant that no matter how far I got from myself that I can find my way back to my heart, be kind to all, and that I am loved through this journey called life. There were times where I felt safe around certain people or at a specified locations but I was so far from my own heart that I had no idea how to start to love, forgive, where to start healing and how to feel safe again.</p>

    <p>Through many journeys in my life I have had the pleasure to meet many awesome people. Some were kind and loving, others were critical and judgemental, she'd say those judgemental and critical ones are only judging themselves, let them be. Growing up during the 70's was pretty rough on the rez, there were many parties, hockey tournaments, rodeos, ball tournaments, and most underaged kids were left to fend for themselves, with extended family, or left with the neighbourhood gramma. The 70's & 80's had much death, suicide, alcohol, sexual abuse, rape, lies and gossip. Today it is called economic violence, political and institutional violence, sexual or gender violence, cultural violence, religious violence, cyber-bullying, and information violence.</p>

    <p>While growing up, I had spent more time with my paternal gramma than my own separated parents. When I wasn't with my paternal gramma I survived with my cousins or extended family, we had taken it upon ourselves to look after each other and did the best that we could. When things got too wild in my young life, my gramma would show up and bring me to her home, my safe haven. We all helped with chores for the home including packing water because there was no running water until the early to mid 80's. I learned how to make a fire in a wood stove and to help prepare the sweathouse. All year round twice a week we would build a sweathouse, put medicine in the hot water barrel by the fire, I had clean clothes, my was hair brushed, I had a safe place to sleep, a loving hug, and an abundance of food. This was gramma's love.</p>

    <p>With great love and hope of all of the grandma's, we have an awesome future ahead of us."Keep kind, you never know what is going on within their own home."</p>

    <p>Through my grandma's love, she was able to help me to release those that had passed on by telling me that their job on Earth is done, anything that gran said was the absoute truth. As I grew older I did my best to cope with the deaths including miscarriages and various abuses through alcohol, which created more dispair. Various times in my life I had asked three trusted doctors for anti-depressants, they each disagreed and told me that I could find another way to help myself. Various times I made it to find a councillor that I had trusted and each had helped me to heal a little more. I had also started to colour, journal, bead, use traditional medicines, combine EFT and Ho'oponopono with essential oils, walk, enjoy the sunshine, breathe fresh air, and drink spring water to start to heal.</p>

    <p>A gentle exercise is walking, we walked to school if we missed the bus or waited until the "Price is Right" was over for a ride from grandpa, walked to visit family. In more recent years my sister-in-law was 'walking' along with "Leslie Sansone, Walk Off the Pounds", I found a simular DVD and also started walking to start moving my body. While healing, I had found a short video about tapping/EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique), with Nick Ortner and Louise Hay. Even though we did not have the same experiences, going through the movements and saying the words, I had felt relief in my heart, mind, and body for the first time in a long time. Sometime while working through Nick Ortners, "The Tapping Solution," I had awaken without the "crazy shit" going on through my head that had repeated for many years.</p>

  <p>With every breath and heartbeat the whole self wants to be healthy, including; the heart, mind, body, and spirit. These words are for a mixture of all of the kind, beautiful, strong, loving, caring, outspoken, understanding, patient, and powerful women that helped me to be alive today. Bless you for your unconditional love.</p>
  <p>Cheers to all of the grandmothers that unconditionally loved each and every one of us in great hopes to make a better world than each of them  had grown in. Cheers to my sober gramma who did not push religion onto me but showed how to collect medicines and preserve from the land. Cheers to my religious alcoholic gramma who showed me that no matter how much a person is hurt, they will most likely keep hurting themselves with alcohol until they can forgive themselves for things beyond their control. Bless my spritual gramma who showed unconditional love in my life by continously praying for me. Bless the "retired registered nurse" gramma who told me how to take care of my physical body when I was a young mother with my first son. Bless the grammas who have adoped and taken in all children and did the best that they could to raise a new generation.</p>
