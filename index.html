    <p>My grandma told me that I can always find my way home. At the time I was not sure what she meant but I think she meant that no matter how far I go from myself, that I can find my way back to my heart. Sometimes in my life there were people or places where I felt safe but I was so far from my own heart and self love that I had no idea where to go or how to heal myself. </p>
    <p>Through many journeys in my life. I have had the pleasure to meet many awesome people. Some were kind and some were judgemental but the kind always win.</>
