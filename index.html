    <p>My grandma told me that I can always find my way home. She meant that no matter how far I go from myself, that I can find my way back to my heart and to treat others the way I want to be treated. There were people or places where I felt safe but I was so far from my own heart that I had no idea where to go or how to start to heal myself. </p>
    <p>Through many journeys in my life. I have had the pleasure to meet many awesome people. Some were kind and some were judgemental but the kind always win, those judgemental ones are only judging themselves. Growing up during the 70's was pretty rough on the rez, parties, hockey, rodeo, ball tournaments, kids left for days at a time to fend for themselves or left with gramma. When I wasn't with my gramma I was with my cousins, we had taken it upon ourselves to look after each other and we did the best that we could.</p>
    <p>The 70's & 80's were filled with death, suicide, alcohol, sexual abuse, rape, lies and gossip. Most of the males had commite suicide on my mom's side of the family by the 90's. There is still suicide within my community. In the early 90's there were 6 suicides, my cousins were not even mid-teens.</p>
    <p>Through my grandma's love, she was able to help me to release those that had passed on by telling me that their job on Earth is done. As I grew older I did my best to cope with all of these deaths through alcohol which created more dispair. One day I was crying outside because I had had enough of the "crazy shit" that was going on in my mind, horrible words repeateding. I found a short video about tapping/EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique), I followed along and felt relief in my heart for the first time in a long, long time.</p>
    <p>While growing up, I had spent more time with my paternal gramma than my own mom or dad. When things got too wild, my gramma would show up and bring me to her safe home. We would have a sweathouse, medicine in the barrel by the fire, clean clothes, hair brushed, a safe place to sleep, a hug, regular school, and an abundance of food. This was gramma's love. "Keep kind, you never know what is going on within their own home."</p>
    <p>Cheers to all of the grandmothers that unconditionally loved each and every one of us in great hopes to make a better world than each of them  had grown in.</p>
